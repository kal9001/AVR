These projects are not my own, but are ones found online, but not apparently yet on gidhub and are mostly for my own reference.

They are copied unedited and retain their origonal licensing, tyops, comments...etc
The only exception is a readme added to each project outlining where I found it, what it does, why I used it...etc.

If anybody viewing these pages knows of an existing official github project for these then please let me know.
